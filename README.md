Overview
This repository contains three Operating Systems lab assignments completed as part of the 5th-semester curriculum.
Each assignment demonstrates the implementation of core OS concepts through practical programming in C and Python on a Linux environment.

Assignment 1 — Process Management in Linux
Objective: Understand process creation, execution, and management using system calls.

Included Tasks:
Creating and Managing Processes: Using fork() to create multiple child processes.
Executing External Commands: Using exec() to run commands like ls -l.
Special Process States: Demonstrating Zombie and Orphan processes.
Process Information Access: Reading process details from the /proc filesystem.
Process Priority Management: Adjusting CPU scheduling priority using the nice command.

Assignment 2 — Process Scheduling and Subtasks
Objective: Implement various CPU scheduling algorithms and explore multi-process operations.

Included Components:
Subtasks:
Process creation and joining (subtask1_logging.py, subtask2_function.py, etc.)
Logging and inter-process communication
Scheduling Algorithms:
FCFS (First Come First Serve)

Objective: Simulate batch execution, system startup behavior, IPC mechanisms, VM detection, and extended CPU scheduling.

Included Tasks:
Task 1 — Batch Processing Simulation (Python)
Simulate batch processing by executing multiple Python scripts sequentially using subprocess.
Task 2 — System Startup & Logging
Simulate a mini system boot sequence using multiprocessing and logging..
Task 3 — System Calls & IPC (fork, exec, pipe)
Implement system calls and inter-process communication using pipes.
Task 4 — VM Detection & Shell Interaction
Use a shell script to display system details and a Python script to detect virtualization.
Task 5 — CPU Scheduling Algorithms (Extended)
Implement: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin ,Priority Scheduling.
